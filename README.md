# Flickr-Gallery

This is a simple Android application that shows the last picture uploaded to Flickr. In order to work, it needs a valid Flickr API key specified in the com.hotmoka.android.gallery.controller.ListOfPicturesFetcher source code. Get one for free from https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

The code of this application shows the definition of alternative layouts and functionality for phone (master or detail) and tablet (master and detail, together). It also shows the use of the MVC framework to deal with background tasks in Android.
